Protagonist
Personality
ENFJ-A / ENFJ-T

STRENGTHS: 

Receptive – Protagonists have strong opinions, but they’re far from closed-minded. They recognize the importance of allowing others to express themselves fully. Even when Protagonists don’t agree with someone, they recognize that person’s right to voice their truth.

Reliable – Few things bother Protagonists more than the prospect of letting down a person or cause that they believe in. People with this personality type can be counted on to see their promises and responsibilities through – even when it’s difficult to do so.

Passionate – Protagonists are far from being boring do-gooders. These types brim with interests, and they take great pleasure in pursuing their hobbies – whether that’s hiking, cooking, dancing, growing houseplants, or something else entirely. As a result, they rarely find themselves at a loss for something interesting to do.

Altruistic – These personalities are known for harboring a deep desire to be a force for positive change. Protagonists genuinely believe that if they bring people together, they can do a world of good.

Charismatic – Determined and inspiring, Protagonists often find their way into leadership roles. Whether they’re captain of their softball team or a leader on the world stage, they rarely lose sight of their main goal: to be of service to others.

WEAKNESSES: 

Unrealistic – Many Protagonists put pressure on themselves to right every wrong that they encounter. But no matter how hard these personalities strive, it just isn’t realistic for them to solve all of the world’s problems. If they aren’t careful, they can spread themselves too thin – and be left unable to help anyone.

Overly Idealistic – Protagonists tend to have clear ideas about what’s right and what’s wrong. They often think that everyone shares these fundamental principles – or, at least, that everyone should share these principles. So it can come as a genuine shock to Protagonists when people violate their core values, such as truth or justice.


Intense – When it comes to self-improvement, Protagonists are rarely short on energy or determination. But they may not recognize that not everyone shares these qualities. At times, Protagonists may push others to make changes that they aren’t ready for – or simply aren’t interested in making in the first place.

Overly Empathetic – Compassion is among this personality type’s greatest strengths. But Protagonists have a tendency to take on other people’s problems as their own – a habit that can leave them emotionally and physically exhausted.

OPPORTUNITIES: 

I can take advantage of this growing market my implementing myself with my background education, life skills, and previous careers I have worked in multiple industries.

My Speciality in software development that I have lerned so far is that I am always willing to learn new ideas and find the best and fastest route to complete any problem ahead of me.

My background in working in an office in real estate and accounting will help me rationalize what customers want and how they think with their unfamiliiarity in software development.  I can communicate with them based on my past knowledge with my new skills in software development.

THREATS:

The main obstacle I currently face is my experience in the software development field.  I have seen some job postings and a lot of them are not looking for a starting level software developer.

Some of my weaknesses could lead to threats including my intense personality to always wanting to increase my self-improvement and my sometimes unrealistic pressure I put on myself to take on tasks and get them done in too fast of a time limit.

I also feel like my age oculd hold me back on some job opportunities.  I spent my younger years in college and working a dead end job while some other applicants have been studying software development.

I also have been out of work for a couple months while I was trying to find a new career path.  I am worried I will accept the first job that will head my way without waying the pros and cons of each opportunity.
