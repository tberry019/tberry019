### Hello There! ğŸ‘‹ <!--
**tberry019/tberry019** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

My name is Taylor Berry,  and I am currently studying to become a software developer at Boise CodeWorks.  I graduated University with a BS in Criminal Justice. I began my post college career working in the Real Estate Industry in Accounting and later on in Escrow.  After a few years I got tired of the office life and trying to cliumb the corporate ladder.  I learned about all the opportunities in the tech industry and fell in love with all the creativeness and openess the field has to offer.  

- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning full stack development at Boise CodeWorks.
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: You can reach me at Taylorberry019@gamil.com or www.linkedin.com/in/taylormberry 
- âš¡ Fun fact: I enjoy camping, hunting, fishing, exercising, and being outdoors.  I also love college and NFL football.  Go Ducks, and Go Bengals!
