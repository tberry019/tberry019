### Hello There! 👋 

  My name is Taylor Berry,  and I am currently studying to become a software developer at Boise CodeWorks.  I graduated with a BS from the University of Idaho. I began my post college career working in the Real Estate Industry in Accounting and later on in Escrow.  After a few years I got tired of the office life and trying to climb the corporate ladder which seemed like I had reached my ceiling.  
  I learned about all the opportunities locally and nationally in the tech industry and fell in love with all the creativeness and openess the field has to offer.
  
- 🎓 I am a Certified ScrumMaster.
- 💡 I’m currently learning full stack development at Boise CodeWorks.

- 🏕 I enjoy camping, hunting, fishing, exercising, and pretty much all activities in the outdoors with my dog Arya. 
- 🏉 I love NCAA and NFL football.  Go Ducks, and Go Bengals!  
- 🛩️ I also enjoy traveling and going to places I have never been.
- 💹 I also love trading stocks and learning more about Crypto.
