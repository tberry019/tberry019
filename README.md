### Hello There! ðŸ‘‹ 

  My name is Taylor Berry,  and I am currently studying to become a software developer at Boise CodeWorks.  I graduated with a BS from the University of Idaho. I began my post college career working in the Real Estate Industry in Accounting and later on in Escrow.  After a few years I got tired of the office life and trying to climb the corporate ladder which seemed like I had reached my ceiling.  
  I learned about all the opportunities locally and nationally in the tech industry and fell in love with all the creativeness and openess the field has to offer.  I am a Certified ScrumMaster and and enjoying everything I am learning at Boise CodeWorks. 

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning full stack development at Boise CodeWorks.

- âš¡ Fun fact: I enjoy camping, hunting, fishing, exercising, and being outdoors.  I also love college and NFL football.  Go Ducks, and Go Bengals!  I also enjoy trading stocks and learning more about Crypto.
